# Semi-automatic annotation tool

A semi-automatic text annotation tool is developped by the project. It takes PDF documents as input and processes them automatically by applying the three following steps:
- layout detection,
- optical characters recognition (with PERO OCR),
- named entities recognition (fine-tuned CamemBERT model).

Users can then check and manually correct each automatically detected and processed text section.

# Vector data validation and correction tool

A collaborative tool to validate and edit geospatial data and more is developped to improve data quality by getting a human validation of any type of geospatial data. It allows users to improve this quality by creating, removing, modifying or validating any feature (geometry and attributes).

# Data and historical sources catalogue

A [catalog](https://soduco.github.io/catalog/) has been developped to store, reference and retrieve archival records and digital data used and produced throughout the project.
