The SoDUCo project develops approaches, models and tools to study the evolution of the urban spatial structure in relation with social and professional practices of the population. We develop our study on the reconstitution of the evolution of Paris from 1789 to 1950 using two specific sets of sources: 
- 16 master maps and the complete series of cadastral maps of Paris and its suburbs, which describe the evolution of road networks and urban fabric, 
- trade directories, which provide the professional activities and/or the social status of people localized by their individual addresses. 

The project team thus develops approaches, models and tools to automatically extract the useful information from both sources, and to collaboratively check, control and refine every information extracted. It aims at building, analysing and publishing an important open database on the social and urban history of Paris.

The project is committed to an open science approach: all publications, data, models and tools developed will be published under an open licence to foster their reuse in other contexts on different time periods, other cities and other scales.
