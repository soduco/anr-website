The SODUCO project and the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France are jointly organising a series of seminars on the historical sources processed by the project and on the approaches developed - in the SODUCO project, but also in other research projects - to extract useful information from these sources and analyse them. 

The second seminar focuses on **the processing pipeline of 18th and 19th century cartographic documents at the BnF and the formalized spatial analysis of geo-historical data in SoDUCo**. 

Registration is free but mandatory. The program and the registration form (in French) are available [here](https://soduco.github.io/soduco_bnf_seminars/)
