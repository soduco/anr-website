The SODUCO project and the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France are jointly organising a series of seminars on the historical sources processed by the project and on the approaches developed - in the SODUCO project, but also in other research projects - to extract useful information from these sources and analyse them. 

The fourth seminar title is **"Restoring commercial directories addresses and spatial evolutions in 19th century Paris - Sharing the experience and resources of the SoDUCo programme. Closing seminar of the ANR SoDUCo programme."**
