The SODUCO project and the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France are jointly organising a series of seminars on the historical sources processed by the project and on the approaches developed - in the SODUCO project, but also in other research projects - to extract useful information from these sources and analyse them. 

The fourth seminar title is "Restoring commercial directories addresses and spatial evolutions in 19th century Paris - Sharing the experience and resources of the SoDUCo programme. Closing seminar of the ANR SoDUCo programme."

Registration is free but mandatory. The program and the registration form (in French) will be soon available [here](https://soduco.github.io/soduco_bnf_seminars/)
