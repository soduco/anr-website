The SODUCO project and the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France are jointly organising a series of seminars on the historical sources processed by the project and on the approaches developed - in the SODUCO project, but also in other research projects - to extract useful information from these sources and analyse them. 

The third seminar focuses on **Sharing the experience and resources of the SoDUCo programme. Open data, free tools, collaborative science.** 

Registration is free but mandatory. The program and the registration form (in French) will be soon available [here](https://soduco.github.io/soduco_bnf_seminars/)
