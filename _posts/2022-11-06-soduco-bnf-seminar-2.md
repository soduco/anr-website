The SODUCO project and the Bibliothèque Nationale de France are jointly organising a series of seminars on the historical sources processed by the project and on the approaches developed - in the SODUCO project, but also in other research projects - to extract useful information from these sources and analyse them. 

The second seminar focuses on **the 19th century Parisian trade directories**. 

It will be run in a hybrid format: participants are welcome to join the seminar on site (at the BNF, site François Mitterrand) or remotely. Registration is free but mandatory. The program and the registration form (in French) are available [here](https://soduco.github.io/soduco_bnf_seminars/)
