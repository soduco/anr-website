The Verniquet workshop brings together researchers from the SODUCO project and other partner institutions to work on the Verniquet Atlas. The aim is to critically analyse the Verniquet Atlas and especially its planimetric accuracy. We want to assess its potential as a historical cartographic reference.

## Inventory of copies of the Verniquet atlas and other archival records pertaining to it

## Assessment of the planimetric accuracy of the Verniquet Atlas

## The Verniquet projected coordinate reference system

One of the results of the Verniquet workshop is the reconstitution of the parameters of the projected coordinate reference system defined and used by Edme Verniquet to draw up his map of Paris. This reference coordinate system was reused throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> century in many other maps of Paris. Knowing the parameters of this system allows it to be integrated into current Geographic Information System softwares and to process cartographic data natively defined in this coordinates reference system without having to transform them first into a modern reference coordinate system.
